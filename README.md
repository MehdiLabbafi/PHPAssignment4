Assignment 4, Project 15-1: Improve Validation

To test the customer management functionality, please follow these steps:

	**1. Access the Manage Customers Page:**
   From the main menu, select the Manage Customers option.

**2. Search for a Customer by Last Name:**
   On the Search Customers page, enter Smith in the "Last Name" field.
   Click the Search button to display a list of customers with the last name "Smith."

**3. Select a Customer from the List:**
   From the displayed list of customers, select a customer (for example, "Priscilla Smith").
   Click the Select button to navigate to the View/Update Customer page.

**4. Test Updating Customer Information:**
   On the View/Update Customer page, the selected customer’s details will be shown. For testing:
   Leave one of the required fields, such as Last Name or State, empty.
   Click the Update Customer button.
   If any required fields are left blank, an error message will appear in red next to the field indicating that it is required.
   All fields must be properly filled out before the customer information can be successfully updated.

**5. Expected Outcome:**
   Once all required fields are correctly filled and errors are resolved, the customer’s information will be updated, and you will be redirected back to the Search Customers page.

This process will ensure the validation and updating functionality works correctly for customer data management.
